# Intro to express

## Getting Started
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `node app.js` to start the node server, listening on port 3000
- Open localhost:3000 in browser to view the webpage

## File Structure
- /server contains the routing and mongoose schemas
- /public contains the public files being served to the web browser
- app.js is the node server, handling all requests
- logger.js is middleware written to console.log the time certain requests took to complete
